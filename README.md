## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <repository-folder-name>
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

    * **Note:** Due to the use of JavaScript ES Modules (`import`/`export` in `game.js` and `casino.js`), you might need to serve the files using a local web server for the game to run correctly. Simply opening `index.html` via the `file:///` protocol can cause issues with module loading in some browsers.
    * A simple way to start a local server (if you have Python installed):
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
        Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown) in your browser.

## üìÇ File Structure

* `index.html`: The main page for the game.
* `body.css`: Contains all the styling for the game's appearance.
* `game.js`: Core game logic, including SP generation, upgrades, achievements, and save/load functionality.
* `casino.js`: Handles the logic for the IT-Lottery and Blackjack games within the casino modal.
* `resolve_ticket_icon.png.jfif`: Icon used for the main click button.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Ideas)

* Fully implement the "Weiterbildung (PDC-Upgrades)" / Prestige system.

* Introduce more types of click upgrades and automated generators.
* Add random events or challenges.
